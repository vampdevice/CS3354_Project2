This Project was created for CS 3354.
Authors: Sebastian Zeidler, Juluissa Elias, and Damian Barrera.

In this project, we were tasked with adding multiple menus and fixing the shooting pattern in a provided Galaga-style game.
Our group added the music menu, shooter/invader image menus, and the bullet menu. 
We also corrected an issue with the game's bullets, causing them to fire continuously if the spacebar is pressed rather than stopping.
